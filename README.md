# Ceaseless DEMO CMS

Welcome to Ceaseless DEMO CMS website.

Demo at: https://ceaseless-demo.herokuapp.com/.  Thank you for trying the demo.

This app was built using Ruby on Rails, a Ruby web framework, and followed MVC architecture and RESTful routing patterns. I also developed user authentication to allow for user signup and login processes.
